      <li>okay how do I upload to a repo from my own repo</li>
      <li>I have not uploaded my own site</li>
      <li>I used bootstraps classes to set how many columns are displayed when on a large screen (3 cols), medium screen
        (2 cols), and
        small screen (1 col). </li>
      <li>My site contains three pages. One for the planets, one for planets, one for moons, and one for the favorites
        tab.</li>
      <li>My site includes a header which is for the navbar and the h1. This is true for each page. </li>
      <li>My site includes navigation links on each page. They link to each of my three pages.</li>
      <li>My site includes alt text on the images. The alt text just states the planet or moon that the person is
        looking at.</li>
      <li>Each page, and stylesheet, validates without any warnings. The only issue I found is one contrast warning
        talking about the search button but its white on green and it won't show me where the error is anymore.</li>
      <li>I am using two different fonts. They are defined in the styles/style.css file.</li>
      <li>My site includes one form. The form is for searching through the moons and planets.</li>
      <li>My site doesn't include links to other websites as of right now. It is supposed to be put on the modals, which
        aren't made yet</li>
      <li>My site makes one network request using fetch. I am fetching data from the wikimedia API.</li>
